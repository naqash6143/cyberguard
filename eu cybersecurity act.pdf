                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref3" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017PC0477#footnote3">2</a>

               </span><span> (the 'NIS Directive'), which form the basis for the present proposal. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Furtherm</span><span>ore, in </span><span>2016 the European Commission adopted a Communication</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>on Strengthening Europe's Cyber Resilience System and Fostering a Competitive and Innovative Cybersecurity Industry</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref5" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017PC0477#footnote5">4</a>
               </span><span>, in which </span><span>further measures were announced </span><span>to step-up </span><span>cooperation, information </span><span>and knowledge sharing and to increase the EU’s resilience and preparedness, also taking into account the prospect of large scale incidents and a possible pan-European cybersecurity crisis. </span><span>In this context, the Commission announced that it would bring forwa</span><span>rd the </span><span>evaluation</span><span> and </span><span>review</span><span> of Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning ENISA and repealing Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 ("ENISA Regulation"). The evaluation process could lead to a possible reform of the Agency </span><span>and an enhancement of its capabilities and capacities to support Member States in a sustainable manner. It would therefore give it a more operational and central role in achieving cybersecurity resilience and would acknowledge in its new mandate the Agency</span><span>’s new responsibilities under the NIS Directive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The NIS Directive is a first essential step with a view to promoting a culture of risk management, by introducing security requirements as legal obligations for the key economic actors, notably operators providing essential services (Operators of Essential Services – OES) and suppliers of some key digital services (Digital Service Providers – DSPs). With security requirements being seen as essential to safeguard the benefits of the evolving digitalisation of society, and given the rapid proliferation of connected devices (the Internet of Things – IoT), the 2016 Communication also put forward the idea of establishing a framework for security certification for ICT products and services in order to increase trust and security in the digital single market. ICT cybersecurity certification becomes particularly relevant in view of the increased use of technologies which require a high level of cybersecurity, such as connected and automated cars, electronic health or industrial automation control systems (IACS). </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>These policy measures and announcements were further reinforced by the 2016 </span><span>Council Conclusions</span><span>, which acknowledged that "cyber threats and vulnerabilities continue to</span><span> evolve and intensify which will require continued and closer cooperation, especially in handling large-scale cross-border cybersecurity incidents". The conclusions reaffirmed that "the ENISA Regulation is one of the core elements of an EU cyber resilience</span><span> framework"</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref6" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017PC0477#footnote6">5</a>
               </span><span> and called upon the Commission to take further steps to address issue of certification at the European level.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The establishment of a certification system would require the setting-up of an appropriate governance system at EU level, including thorough expertise provided by an independent EU agency. In this respect, the present proposal identifies ENISA as the natural EU-level body competent on cybersecurity matters which should take up such role to bring together, and coordinate the work of, national competent bodies in the field of certification. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In its Communication on the </span><span>DSM Strategy Mid-term Review of May 2017</span><span>, the Commission further specified that by September 2017 it would review the mandate of ENISA. This in order to define its role in t</span><span>he changed cybersecurity ecosystem and develop measures on cybersecurity standards, certification and labelling to make ICT-based systems, including connected objects, more cyber-secure.</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               <span>In the course of the negotiations of the NIS Directive, the EU co-legislators decided to attribute important roles to ENISA in the implementation of this Directive. In particular, the Agency provides the secretariat to the CSIRTs Network (established to promote swift and effective operational cooperation between Member States on specific cybersecurity incidents and sharing information about risks), and it is also called on to assist the Cooperation Group in the execution of its tasks. In addition, the Directive requires ENISA to assist Member States and the Commission by providing expertise and advice and by facilitating the exchange of best practices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In accordance with the ENISA Regulation, the Commission has carried out an evaluation of the Agency which includes an independent study as well as a public consultation. The evaluation assessed the relevance, impact, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and EU added value of the Agency with regard to its performance, governance, internal organisational structure and working practices during the period 2013-2016.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>However, a large majority (88%) of respondents considered the current instruments and mechanisms available at EU level to be insufficient or only partially adequate in addressing the current cybersecurity challenges. A large majority of respondents (98%) indicated that an EU body should address these needs, and among them ENISA was considered to be the right organisation to do so by 99% of the respondents. In addition, 67.5 % of respondents expressed the view that ENISA could play a role in establishing a harmonized framework for security certification of IT products and services. </span>

               <span class="list-symbol"><span class="num">·</span></span><span>ENISA managed to make an impact, at least to some extent, in the vast field of network and information security, but it has not fully succeeded in deve</span><span>loping a strong brand name and gaining sufficient visibility to become recognised as "the" centre of expertise in Europe. The explanation for this lies in the broad mandate of ENISA, which was not equipped with proportionally sufficient resources. Furtherm</span><span>ore, ENISA remains the only EU agency with a fixed-term mandate, thus limiting its ability to develop a long-term vision and support its stakeholders in a sustainable manner. This also contrasts with the provisions of the NIS Directive, which entrust ENISA</span><span> with tasks with no end date. Finally, the assessment found that this limited effectiveness can partly be explained by the high reliance on external expertise over in-house expertise, and by the difficulties in recruiting and retaining specialised staff.</span>

               <span class="list-symbol"><span class="num">·</span></span><span>L</span><span>ast but not least, the evaluation concluded that ENISA’s added value lies primarily in the Agency’s ability to enhance cooperation mainly between Member States, and especially with related network and information security communities (in particular between</span><span> CSIRTs). There is no other actor at EU level that supports such broad scope of network and information security stakeholders. However, due to the need to strictly prioritise its activities, ENISA’s work programme is mostly guided by the needs of Member St</span><span>ates. As a result, it does not sufficiently address the needs of other stakeholders, in particular the industry. It also made the Agency reactive to fulfilling the needs of its key stakeholders, preventing it from achieving a bigger impact. Therefore, the </span><span>added value provided by the Agency varied according to the diverging needs of its stakeholders and to the extent to which the Agency was able to respond to them (e.g. large versus small Member States; Member States versus industry). </span>

            <p class="Normal">

               <span>In order to establish and preserve trust and security, ICT products and services need to directly incorporate security features in the early stages of their technical design and development (security by design).

               <span>Certification, which consists of the formal evaluation of products, service</span><span>s and processes by an independent and accredited body against a defined set of criteria standards and the issuing of a certificate indicating conformance, plays an important role in increasing trust and security in products and services. While security eva</span><span>luations are quite a technical area, certification serves the purpose to inform and reassure purchasers and users about the security properties of the ICT products and services that they buy or use. As mentioned above, this is particularly relevant for new</span><span> systems that make extensive use of digital technologies and which require a high level of security, such as e.g. connected and automated cars, electronic health, industrial automation control systems (IACS)</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref15" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017PC0477#footnote15">14</a>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Currently, the landscape of cybersecurity certification of ICT products and services in the EU is quite patchy. There are a number of international initiatives, such as the so-called Common Criteria (CC) for Information Technology Security Evaluation (ISO 15408), which is an international standard for computer security evaluation. It is based on third party evaluation and envisages seven Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL). The CC and the companion Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation (CEM) are the technical basis for an international agreement, the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA), which ensures that CC certificates are recognized by all the signatories of the CCRA. However, within the current version of the CCRA only evaluations up to EAL 2 are mutually recognized. Moreover, only 13 Member States have signed the Arrangement. </span>

               </span><span>. Moreover, a number of ICT certification initiatives currently exist or are being established in Member States. Even if important, these initiatives bear the risk of creating market fragmentation and interoperability issues. As </span><span>a consequence, a company may need to undergo several certification procedures in various Member States to be able to offer its product on multiple markets. For example, a smart meter manufacturer who wants to sell its products in three Member States, e.g. </span><span>Germany, France and UK, currently needs to comply with three different certification schemes. These are the Commercial Product Assurance (CPA) in the UK, Certification de Sécurité de Premier Niveau in France (CSPN) and a specific protection profile based o</span><span>n Common Criteria in Germany.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>This situation leads to higher costs and constitutes a considerable administrative burden for companies operating in several Member States. While the cost of certification may vary significantly depending on the product/service concerned, the evaluation assurance level sought and/or other components, in general this tends to be quite considerable for businesses. For the BSI “Smart Meter Gateway” certificate, for example, the cost is more than EUR one million (highest level of test and assurance, concerns not only one product but the whole infrastructure around it as well). The cost for smart meters certification in the UK is almost EUR 150 000. In France, the cost is similar to the UK, about EUR 150 000 or more.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Key public and private stakeholders recognised that in the absence of an EU-wide cybersecurity certification scheme, companies in many circumstances have to be certified individually in each Member State, thus leading to market fragmentation. Most importantly, in the absence of EU harmonisation legislation for ICT products and services, differences in cybersecurity certification standards and practices in Member States are liable to create 28 separate security markets in the EU in practice, each one with its own technical requirements, testing methodologies and cybersecurity certification procedures. These divergent approaches at national level are liable to cause – should no adequate action be taken at EU level – a significant setback in the achievement of the digital single market, slowing down or preventing the connected positive effects in terms of growth and jobs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Building on the above developments, the proposed Regulation establishes a European Cybersecurity Certification Framework (the "</span><span>Framework</span><span>") for ICT products and services and specifies the essential functions and tasks of ENISA in the field of cybersecurity certification. The present proposal lays down an overall framework of rules governing European cybersecurity certification schemes. The proposal does not introduce directly operational certification schemes, but rather create a system (framework) for the establishment of specific certification schemes for specific ICT products/services (the "European cybersecurity certification schemes"). The creation of European cybersecurity certification schemes in accordance with the Framework will allow certificates issued under those schemes to be valid and recognised across all Member States and to address the current market fragmentation. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The general purpose of a Europe</span><span>an cybersecurity certification scheme is to attest that the ICT products and services that have been certified in accordance with such scheme comply with specified cybersecurity requirements. This for instance would include their ability to protect data (w</span><span>hether stored, transmitted or otherwise processed) against accidental or unauthorised storage, processing, access, disclosure, destruction, accidental loss or alteration. EU cybersecurity certification schemes would make use of existing standards in relati</span><span>on to the technical requirements and evaluation procedures that the products need to comply with and would not develop the technical standards themselves</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref17" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017PC0477#footnote17">16</a>
               </span><span>. For instance, an EU-wide certification for products such as smart cards, which are currently tested </span><span>against international CC standards under the multilateral SOG-IS scheme (and described previously), would mean making this scheme valid throughout the EU.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In addition to outlining a specific set of security objectives to be taken into account in the design of a specific European cybersecurity certification scheme, the proposal provides what the minimum content of such schemes should be. Such schemes will have to define, among others, a number of specific elements setting out the scope and object of the cybersecurity certification. This includes the identification of the categories of products and services covered, the detailed specification of the cybersecurity requirements (for example by reference to the relevant standards or technical specifications), the specific evaluation criteria and methods, and the level of assurance they are intended to ensure (i.e. basic, substantial or high).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>European cybersecurity certification schemes will be prepared by ENISA, with the assistance, expert advice and close cooperation of the European Cybersecurity Certification Group (see below), and adopted by the Commission by means of implementing acts. When the need for a cybersecurity certification scheme is identified, the Commission will request ENISA to prepare a scheme for specific ICT products or services. ENISA will work on the scheme in close cooperation with national certification supervisory authorities represented in the Group. Member States and the Group may propose to the Commission that it requests ENISA to prepare a particular scheme. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Certification can be a very expensive process, which in turn could lead to higher prices for customers and consumers. The need to certify may also vary significantly according to the specific context of use of the products and services and fast pace of technological change. Recourse to European cybersecurity certification should therefore remain voluntary, unless otherwise provided in Union legislation laying down security requirements of ICT products and services. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In order to ensure harmonisation and avoid fragmentation, national cybersecurity certification schemes or procedures for the ICT products and services covered by a European cybersecurity certification scheme will cease to apply from the date established in the implementing act adopting the scheme. Member States should furthermore not introduce new national cybersecurity certification schemes for the ICT products and services covered by an existing European cybersecurity certification scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Once a European cybersecurity certification scheme is adopted, manufacturers of ICT products or providers of ICT services will be able to submit an application for certification of their products or services to a conformity assessment body of their choice. Conformity assessment bodies should be accredited by an accreditation body if they comply with certain specified requirements. Accreditation will be issued for a maximum of five years and may be renewed on the same conditions provided that the conformity assessment body meets the requirements. Accreditation bodies will revoke an accreditation of a conformity assessment body where the conditions for the accreditation are not, or are no longer, met, or where actions taken by a conformity assessment body infringe this Regulation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Under the proposal, the monitoring, supervisory and enforcement tasks lie with the Member States. Member States will have to provide for one certification supervisory authority. This authority will be tasked with supervising the compliance of conformity assessment bodies, as well as of certificates issued by conformity assessment bodies established in their territory, with the requirements of this Regulation and the relevant European cybersecurity certification schemes. National certification supervisory authorities will be competent to handle complaints lodged by natural or legal persons in relation to certificates issued by conformity assessment bodies established in their territories. To the appropriate extent, they will investigate the subject matter of the complaint and inform the complainant of the progress and the outcome of the investigation within a reasonable time period. Moreover, they will cooperate with other certification supervisory authorities or other public authorities, for instance by sharing information on possible non-compliance of ICT products and services with the requirements of this Regulation or with the specific European cybersecurity certification schemes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Finally, the proposal establishes the European Cybersecurity Certification Group (the 'Group'), consisting of national certification supervisory authorities of all Member States. The main task of the Group is to advise the Commission on issues concerning cybersecurity certification policy and to work with ENISA on the development of draft European cybersecurity certification schemes. ENISA will assist the Commission in providing the secretariat of the Group and maintain an updated public inventory of schemes approved under the European Cybersecurity Certification Framework. ENISA would also liaise with standardisation bodies to ensure the appropriateness of standards used in approved schemes and to identify areas in need of cybersecurity standards.</span>

In addition, activities that would reflect the objectives to increase cooperation and coordination among Member States and those adding EU level capabilities to complement the action of Member States would fall under the category of "operational cooperation". This is specifically identified by the NIS Directive (for which Article 114 TFEU is the legal basis) as an objective to be pursued in the context of the CSIRTs Network where "ENISA shall provide the secretariat and shall actively support the cooperation" (Article 12(1)). In particular, Article 12(f) further outlines the identification of further forms of operational cooperation as task of the CSIRTs Network, including in relation to: (i) categories of risks and incidents; (ii) early warnings; (iii) mutual assistance; and (iv) principles and modalities for coordination, when Member States respond to cross-border risks and incidents. </span>

The interdependencies between networks and information systems are such that individual actors (public and private, including citizens) very often cannot face the threats, manage the risks and the possible impacts of cyber incidents in isolation. On the one hand, the interdependencies across Member States, including with regard to the operation of critical infrastructures (energy, transport, water, just to name a few) make public intervention at the European level not only beneficial, but also needed. On the other hand, EU intervention can bring a positive "spill over" effect due to the sharing of good practices across Member States, which can result in an enhanced cybersecurity of the Union.</span>

Indeed, Member States and EU bodies rely on its substantial expertise on cybersecurity matters.

Cybersecurity continues to be a key political priority of the EU to which ENISA is expected to respond; however, ENISA’s design as EU agency with a fixed-term</span><span> mandate: (i) does not allow for long-term planning and sustainable support to Member States and EU institutions; (ii) may lead to a legal vacuum as the provisions of the NIS Directive entrusting ENISA with tasks are of a permanent nature</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               <span class="list-symbol"><span class="num">·</span></span><span>Effectiveness</span><span>: </span><span>ENISA</span><span> overall met its objectives and implemented its tasks. It made a contribution to increased network and information security in Europe through its main activit</span><span>ies (capacity building, provision of expertise, community building, and support to policy). It, however, showed potential for improvement in relation to each.  The evaluation concluded that ENISA has effectively created strong and trustful relationships wi</span><span>th some of its stakeholders, notably with the Member States and the CSIRTs community. Interventions in the area of capacity building were perceived as effective in particular for less resourced Member States. Stimulating broad cooperation has been one of t</span><span>he highlights, with stakeholders widely agreeing on the positive role ENISA plays in bringing people together. However, ENISA faced difficulties to make a big impact in the vast field of network and information security. This was also due to the fact it ha</span><span>d fairly limited human and financial resources to meet a very broad mandate. The evaluation also concluded that ENISA partially met the objective of providing expertise, linked to the problems in recruiting experts (see also below in the efficiency section</span><span>). </span>
            </p>
            <p class="li Bullet0">
               <span class="list-symbol"><span class="num">·</span></span><span>Efficiency</span><span>: Despite its small budget – among the lowest compared to other EU agencies – the Agency has been able to contribute to targeted objectives, showing overall efficiency in the use of its resources. The evaluation concluded that processes gener</span><span>ally were efficient and a clear delineation of responsibilities within the organisation led to a good execution of the work. One of the main challenges to the Agency’s efficiency relates to ENISA’s difficulties in recruiting and retaining highly qualified </span><span>experts. The findings show that this can be explained by a combination of factors, including the general difficulties across the public sector to compete with the private sector when trying to hire highly specialised experts, the type of contracts (fixed t</span><span>erm) that the Agency could mostly offer and the somewhat low level of attractiveness related to ENISA's location, for example linked to difficulties encountered by spouses to find work. A location split between Athens and Heraklion required additional effo</span><span>rts of coordination and generated additional costs, but the move to Athens in 2013 of the core operations department increased the Agency's operational efficiency.</span>

               <span class="list-symbol"><span class="num">·</span></span><span>Coherence</span><span>: ENISA’s activities have been generally coherent with the policies and activities </span><span>of its stakeholders, at national and EU level, but there is a need for a more coordinated approach to cybersecurity at EU level. The potential for cooperation between ENISA and other EU bodies has not been fully utilised. The evolution in the EU legal and </span><span>policy landscape make the current mandate less coherent today.</span>

               <span class="list-symbol"><span class="num">·</span></span><span>EU-added value</span><span>: ENISA’s added value lies primarily in the Agency’s ability to enhance cooperation, mainly between Member States but also with related network and information security communitie</span><span>s. There is no other actor at EU level that supports the cooperation of the same variety of stakeholders on network and information security. The added value provided by the Agency varied according to the diverging needs and resources of its stakeholders (</span><span>e.g. large versus small Member States; Member States versus industry) and the need for the Agency to prioritise its activities according to the work programme. The evaluation concluded that a potential discontinuation of ENISA would be a lost opportunity f</span><span>or all Member States. It will not be possible to ensure the same degree of community building and cooperation across the Member States in the field of cybersecurity. Without a more centralised EU agency the picture would be more fragmented, with bilateral </span><span>or regional cooperation stepping in to fill a void left by ENISA. </span>

               <span>The analysis led to the conclusion that a "reformed ENISA" in combination with an EU general ICT cybersecurity certification framework is the preferred option. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The preferred option has been assessed as the most effective for the EU to reach the identified objectives of: increasing cybersecurity capabilities, preparedness, cooperation, awareness, transparency and avoiding market fragmentation. It has also been assessed as the most coherent with policy priorities of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy and related policies (e.g. NIS Directive), and the Digital Single Market Strategy. In addition, from the consultation process, it emerged that the preferred option enjoys the support of the majority of stakeholders. Furthermore, the analysis conducted in the impact assessment showed that the preferred option would reach the objectives through a reasonable employment of resources.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The Commission’s Regulatory Scrutiny Board delivered initially a negative opinion on 24 July, then a positive opinion on 25 August 2017 upon resubmission. The amended Impact Assessment report included additional supporting evidence, the final conclusions of the evaluation of ENISA and additional explanations on the policy options and their impact. Annex 1 to the final Impact Assessment report summarizes how the comments of the Board in the second opinion have been addressed. In particular, the report was updated to present in greater detail the EU cybersecurity context, including the measures that are included in the Joint Communication "Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building strong cybersecurity for the EU", (JOIN(2017) 450) and have a special relevance for ENISA: the EU cybersecurity blueprint and the European Cybersecurity Research and Competence Centre, to which the Agency would link its advisories on EU research needs. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The report explains how the reform of the Agency, including the new tasks, the better conditions of employment and the structural cooperation with EU bodies in the field, would improve its attractiveness as employer and help tackle problems related to the recruitment of experts. Annex 6 to the report also presents a revised estimate of costs associated to the policy options for ENISA. With regard to the topic of certification, the report has been revised to provide a more detailed explanation, including graphic presentation, of the preferred option, as well as to provide estimates on the costs for Member States and the Commission related to the new certification framework. The rationale for the choice of ENISA as key actor in the framework has been further explained based on its expertise in the field and the fact that it is only EU level agency on cybersecurity. Finally, the sections on certification were reviewed to clarify aspects related to the difference between the current SOG-IS system, the benefits associated to the different policy options and explain that fact that the type of ICT product and service covered by a European certification scheme will be defined in the approved scheme itself.</span>

               <span>Cybersecurity has an essential role in protecting the privacy and personal data of individuals in accordance with Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. In case of cyber incidents the privacy and the protection of our personal data are clearly exposed. Cybersecurity is thus a necessary condition for the respect of privacy and confidentiality of our personal data. Under this perspective, by aiming to reinforce cybersecurity in Europe, the proposal provides an important complement to the existing legislation protecting the fundamental right to privacy and personal data. Cybersecurity is also essential for protecting the confidentiality of our electronic communications and thus for exercising the freedom of expression and information and other related rights, such as the freedom of thought, conscience and religion.</span>

Similarly, in the Mid-Term Review on the implementati</span><span>on of the Digital Single Market Strategy, the Commission highlighted the need for safe connected products and systems, and indicated that the creation of a European ICT security framework setting rules on how to organise ICT security certification in the U</span><span>nion could both preserve trust in the internet and tackle the current fragmentation of the cybersecurity market.</span>

               <span class="num"><span>(50)</span></span><span>Currently, the cybersecurity certification of ICT products and services is used only to a limited extent. When it exists, it mostly occurs</span><span> at Member State level or in the framework of industry driven schemes. In this context, a certificate issued by one national cybersecurity authority is not in principle recognised by other Member States. Companies thus may have to certify their products an</span><span>d services in several Member States where they operate, for example with a view to participating in national procurement procedures. Moreover, while new schemes are emerging, there seems to be no coherent and holistic approach with regard to horizontal cyb</span><span>ersecurity issues, for instance in the field of the Internet of Things. Existing schemes present significant shortcomings and differences in terms of product coverage, levels of assurance, substantive criteria and actual utilisation. </span>

The most important example in this regard is the Senior Officials Group – Information Systems Security (SOG-IS) Mutu</span><span>al Recognition Agreement (MRA). While it represents the most important model for cooperation and mutual recognition in the field of security certification, SOG-IS MRA presents some significant shortcomings related to its high costs and limited scope. So fa</span><span>r only a few protection profiles on digital products have been developed, such as digital signature, digital tachograph and smart cards. Most importantly, SOG-IS includes only part of the Union Member States. This has limited the effectiveness of SOG-IS MR</span><span>A from the point of view of the internal market. </span>

The European framework should have a twofold purpose: on the one hand, it should help increase trust in ICT products and services that have bee</span><span>n certified according to such schemes. On the other hand, it should avoid the multiplication of conflicting or overlapping national cybersecurity certifications and thus reduce costs for undertakings operating in the digital single market.

The suggested scope of the mandate is delineated, strengthening those areas where the agency has shown clear added value and adding those new areas where support is needed in view of the new policy priorities and instruments, in particular the NIS Directive, the review of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy, the EU Cybersecurity Blueprint for cyber crisis cooperation and ICT security certification. The new proposed mandate seeks to give the Agency stronger and more central role, in particular by also supporting Member States more actively to counter particular threats (operational capacity) and by becoming a centre of expertise supporting Member States and the Commission on cybersecurity certification.</span>

The number, complexity and scale of cybersecurity incidents and their impact on economy and society are growing over time and they are expected to further increase in parallel to technological developments, for example the proliferation of the internet of things.

                        <span>ENISA's added value in bringing cybersecurity communities and stakeholders together is also valid in the field of certification. The rise of cybercrime and security threats has resulted in the emergence of national initiatives setting high-level cybersecurity and certification requirements for ICT components used in traditional infrastructure. Although important, these initiatives bear the risk of creating fragmentation of the single market and barriers for interoperability. An ICT vendor might need to undergo several certification processes to be able to sell in several Member States.The ineffectiveness/inefficiency of the current certification schemes is</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>unlikely to be solved in the absence of EU intervention.  In the absence of action, the market fragmentation is very likely to increase in the short-medium term (next 5-10 years) with the emergence of new certification schemes. The lack of coordination and interoperability across such schemes is an element which decreases the potential of the digital single market. This proves the added value of establishing a European Cybersecurity Certification Framework for ICT products and services putting the right conditions in place for effectively addressing the problem related to the co-existence of multiple certification procedures in various Member States, reducing certification costs and thus making certification in the EU overall more attractive from a commercial and competitive perspective.</span>

                  <span>In accordance with the ENISA legal base, the Commission has carried out an evaluation of the Agency, which included an independent study as well as a public consultation. The evaluation came to a conclusion that ENISA's objectives remain relevant today. In a context of technological developments and evolving threats and of significant need for increased network and information security (NIS) in the EU, there is a need for technical expertise on the evolution of network and information security issues. Capacities need to be built in the Member States to understand and respond to threats, and stakeholders need to cooperate across thematic fields and across institutions.</span>

               <p class="Text1">
                  <span>The agency has been successfully contributing to increased NIS in Europe by offering capacity building in 28 Member States, enhancing cooperation between Member States and NIS stakeholders; provision of expertise, community building and support to policy. </span>

               <p class="Text1">
                  <span>While ENISA managed to make an impact, at least to some extent, in the vast field of NIS but it has not fully succeeded in developing a strong brand name and gaining sufficient visibility to become recognised as "the" centre of expertise in Europe. The explanation for this lies with the broad mandate of ENISA, which was not met with proportionally big resources. Furthermore, ENISA remains the only EU agency with a fixed-term mandate which limits its ability to develop a long term vision and support its stakeholders in a sustainable manner. This is also in contrast with the provisions of the NIS Directive, which entrust ENISA with tasks with no end date.</span>
